# Vehicle Simulation Visualization 🚗📊

This project provides a set of tools and visualizations for analyzing and simulating vehicle activity data.  
The goal is to transform raw vehicle activity logs into meaningful visual insights for performance analysis, traffic dynamics, and resource utilization.

---

## 📌 Features
- Construction of a DataFrame from raw vehicle activity data.
- Detection of the number of vehicles and activity status over time.
- Color-coded visualization of vehicle statuses in a spatial or timeline format.
- Export of results into **interactive HTML** for easy sharing and reporting.
